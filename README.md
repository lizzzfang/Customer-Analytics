# Customer-Analytics
Analyzing customer behavior by predictive analytics

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
CLV analysis uses a python library - [lifetimes](https://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Customer Segmentation 
Customer segmentation is the act of separating the target customers into different groups based on demographic or behavioral data 
so that marketing strategies can be tailored more specifically to each group.

Clustering is used for performing this segmentation.
#### K-Means for clustering continuous data
#### K-Modes for clustering categorical data
#### K-Prototype for clustering mixed typed data
